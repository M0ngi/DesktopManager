# Desktop Manager

An app I made back at 2019 & I'm still using this till now.

The problem is, my desktop used to go full of program shortcuts, so I made this app which used SQLite database & PyQt4 to manage my installed programs.

This actually helped me in reducing shortcuts.

You can use organize your apps by categories too. You just need to rename the database file, change the title & icon then you're ready! I used PyInstaller for building the executable.

Known problems:
* Need a restart to view changes.
* Bad UI

I'm planning to re-work on this app for better performance & UI so I didn't bother to edit the code.
