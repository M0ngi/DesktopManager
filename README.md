# Desktop Manager

An app I made back at 2019 & I'm still using this till now.

The problem is, my desktop used to go full of program shortcuts, so I made this app which used SQLite database & PyQt4 to manage my installed programs.

This actually helped me in reducing shortcuts.

Known problems:
* Need a restart to view changes.
* Bad UI

I'm planning to re-work on this app for better performance & UI so I didn't bother to edit the code.
